    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p><strong>At SylvanNorth, we believe reforestation is more than planting trees—it’s about restoring living relationships.</strong></p>
    <p>We are driven by the understanding that forests are not just ecosystems—they are ancestral landscapes, kinship networks, and teachers. Our mission is to support meaningful reforestation through innovation rooted in respect.</p>
    <p>Our flagship solution, the <strong>BioPod</strong>, is a 100% native, zero-waste planting system designed to accelerate ecological regeneration. Each BioPod is crafted from biodegradable mycelium and coconut coir, embedded with locally adapted, lab-propagated seedlings, and infused with beneficial microbes. This closed-loop design nourishes the soil, supports native biodiversity, and eliminates plastic waste from the planting process.</p>
    <p>But what truly sets us apart is our commitment to <strong>Indigenous-informed reforestation</strong>. We actively collaborate with Indigenous communities, knowledge keepers, and land stewards to ensure our work honours cultural relationships with the land. This includes careful species selection, land-based protocols, and shared stewardship models that go beyond “sustainability” toward <em>reciprocity</em>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Every BioPod is a promise:</strong><br>
      To respect the land.<br>
      To honour ancestral knowledge.<br>
      To regenerate forests that thrive for generations.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We’re not just rebuilding forests—we’re restoring relationships.</p>
